    question: "Understanding NFTs Digital Collectibles",
    answer:
      "NFTs or Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain. Fungibility is a property that denotes interchangeability. An ETH is fungible- one ETH can be swapped for another ETH. Owners of ETH do not particularly care which ETH they own. Whereas in the case of NFTs, this does not hold true.",
